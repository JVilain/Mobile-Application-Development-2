## 📌 Purpose of the Site
This web application was created as part of my Mobile Application Development 2 course project. Its main purpose is to showcase my favorite books, movies, music, restaurants, travel destinations, and podcasts. Users can navigate through the different categories, view content, and add their own favorite items using a simple form. The app uses **Web Storage** to save and display a list of favorite items, ensuring a personalized experience that persists between sessions. The site also incorporates a responsive design using **jQuery Mobile** and a custom theme created with **ThemeRoller**.
